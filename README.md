This repository contains three distinct machine learning projects, each focused on different aspects of predictive modeling. In these projects, we utilize both linear regression and logistic regression techniques. We've included Jupyter notebook code for easy comprehension and replication.

House Price Prediction: In this project, we've built a machine learning model to predict house prices. Using linear regression, the model analyzes various house features to estimate prices accurately. The Jupyter notebook provides clear explanations and step-by-step instructions for training and evaluating the model.

Wine Quality Prediction: Our Wine Quality Prediction project aims to determine wine quality based on specific attributes using linear regression. By training a machine learning model on a dataset containing wine characteristics, the model predicts the quality rating of wines. The Jupyter notebook explains data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Iris Flowers Classification: This project focuses on classifying different iris flower species using logistic regression. By considering petal and sepal lengths, the model accurately identifies the species. The Jupyter notebook offers comprehensive explanations of data preprocessing, model training, and classification.

These projects demonstrate how regression techniques can be applied effectively in various domains for predictive tasks. By exploring the Jupyter notebook code, you can understand the implementation details and apply similar techniques to your own projects.
